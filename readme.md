This repository is part of our project work in electrical power systems 2, NTNU

The goal of this project is to develop a tool to perform load flow studies. Through four different methods, a load flow solver is implemented in Python to conduct further analysis. 


The different solvers can all be studied by running the main.py file.
Further instructions is given when running the code.
